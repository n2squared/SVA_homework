			<li>Display the prompt</li>
			<li>Take the value from the prompt and display on the screen</li>
			<li>Make 2 prompts, add the strings together and display them on the page</li>
			<li>Make a madlibs
				Ask the user for noun
				Ask the user for a verb
				Ask the user for an adjective
				Place those entries into a sentence that has been prewritten
				Display that on the screen
				
				</li> 
			<li>Display 1 more prompt that asks the user for a number between 1 and 3
				Depending on the number, show different stories
				For this, you'll need a conditional (well, a few)
